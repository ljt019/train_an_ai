              In the next step, you'll be asked to draw the numbers 1-9. These
              drawings will be used to train a Convolutional Neural Network
              (CNN) model. As your drawings pass through the layers of the CNN,
              the model will learn to recognize the numbers you draw and be able
              to identify similar numbers in the future. Once training is
              complete, you'll be able to draw more numbers and see the AI
              predict what you've drawnâ€”all thanks to your drawings.

              A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of artificial
              intelligence that's particularly good at processing grid-like
              data, such as images. It's inspired by the human visual cortex and
              is excellent at tasks like image recognition and classification.
